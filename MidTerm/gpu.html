        <h2>Graphics Processing Unit:</h2>
        <p>The graphics processing unit or also known as the graphics card 
            is another important component. What is a graphics processing unit 
            and why is it needed? It is a component that aids the central 
            processing unit in processing graphical data for the computer. 
            An individual would need this component for high-end gaming 
            and applications that would require higher graphics. </p>
    
            <p>Whether an individual is purchasing a pre-build, or they are buying 
                a custom build or even building their own computer, the graphics processing unit 
                is an important component to take into consideration. Graphics processing units 
                come in many shapes and sizes and a person can have a dedicated graphics 
                processing unit or one built onto the central processing unit. The two common 
                manufacturers of graphics processing units are Nvidia and AMD.</p>

    <p>Graphics processing units can range from 100 US dollars to over 
        1000 US dollars, depending on the price point and the power needed for what an 
        individual wants to accomplish with their pre-build or self-built computer. It 
        is thought that a lot of graphics were only used in high-end gaming, but there are 
        other programs that need the high graphics. Some examples would be the graphics needed 
        for machine learning and neural networks, video editing, and programs dealing with 3-D models such as AutoCAD.</p>
