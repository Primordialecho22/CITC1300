        <h2>Motherboard:</h2>
        <p>A component known as the motherboard is another important piece 
            of hardware when deciding the build of a computer. There are different 
            types of motherboards and those motherboards have different slots for other 
            hardware such as RAM slots. Some motherboards will have 2 RAM slots where 
            others will have 4 slots. The motherboard will have different types of ports 
            such as HDMI, DVI, VGA, USB, PS/2, and display port. </p>

            <p>The motherboard will have a different number of PCIe slots where you can 
                install a GPU, SSD, and network cards. Depending on the needs of the individual 
                that is building the computer, whether they need more slots and ports or less slots 
                and ports determines which motherboard they can buy. When an individual is building 
                their own computer, the individual will have to put more thought into a good motherboard. 
                With a person buying a pre-built, they will not choose the motherboard, but if they wanted 
                to customize their pre-built personal computer, they might have that option. </p>

        <p>When a person is building their own computer and deciding what motherboard to purchase 
            it is good to make sure the motherboard is compatible with the processor. The website 
            PC Part Picker allows a person to create custom builds and the site runs checks on components 
            to see if the hardware is compatible. An individual can utilize this site to help guide them in 
            getting started in building their own personal computer. </p>
