        <h2>Random-access Memory:</h2>
        <p>The RAM also known as random-access memory is another component 
            needed to build a computer. What is random-access memory? The random-access 
            memory is a vital component to the computerâ€™s performance. Random-access memory 
            provides a place to store information and retrieve information for short-term use. 
            The random-access memory stores information, so it can be retrieved quickly.  </p>

            <p>The more applications a person has running, the more random-access memory is needed. 
                When a person is building a gaming computer for example, they will often use more RAM versus using 
                less because of the level of performance needed for gaming. If an individual wants to multitask 
                when working from home or at an office, the amount of RAM needed will be more than 4 Gb of RAM. 
                Some programs will require more memory than other programs, therefore the amount of RAM needed will 
                depend on those programs.</p>

    <p>If an individual is buying a pre-built computer there are 
        choices on how much RAM a company will provide. Dell offers 
        many pre-builds at different price points and multiple choices 
        among different models. The consumer would not normally choose the 
        manufacturer of the RAM. The company selling the pre-build would just 
        give the consumer the choice of how many gigabytes they wanted among 
        the different models. If an individual wanted to choose the manufacturer 
        of the RAM a person would have to either build their own computer or have one custom made.</p>
