        <h2>Hard Drive:</h2>
        <p>The hard drive houses the operating system, the files, and programs an 
            individual keeps on the computer. There are different types of hard drives 
            such as the hard disk drive and the solid-state drive. Solid-state drives 
            also known as SSD, store information in nonvolatile memory chips and have no 
            moving pieces. Solid state drives tend to be more durable, quieter, and use 
            low power, but do tend to cost more. </p>

            <img src="Images/HardDrive-01.jpg" alt="Hard Drive">
            <p>The hard disk drives also known as HDD, read and write information using 
                magnetics on multiple disks. The speed in which the disk will write this 
                information is 5400 RPM to 15000 RPM. The cost of hard disk drives is considerably 
                lower than solid-state drives, but hard disk drives are slower in comparison. When 
                a person is building their own personal computer there are different companies selling 
                hard disk drives such as Seagate, Western Digital, and Kingston. Companies selling 
                solid-state drives are Samsung, Crucial, and Western Digital.</p>

    <p>Solid-state drives will be faster at writing information whereas 
        hard disk drives will be slower with noticeable differences. An individual building 
        their computer would be able to install solid-state drives and hard disk drives. Usually 
        with most computer cases, they have multiple slots to install multiple hard disk drives 
        or solid-state drives. When a person is buying a pre-built or creating a custom build, they 
        will still have a good range of solid-state drives and hard disk drives to choose from. An 
        individual purchasing a pre-built would be able to upgrade if there are additional slots available to do so. </p>
