        <h2>What is Horror?</h2>

        <p >Horror story, a story in which the focus is 
            on creating a feeling of fear. Such tales are 
            of ancient origin and form a substantial part 
            of the body of folk literature. They can feature 
            supernatural elements such as ghosts, witches, or 
            vampires, or they can address more realistic 
            psychological fears. In Western literature the 
            literary cultivation of fear and curiosity for its 
            own sake began to emerge in the 18th-century 
            pre-Romantic era with the Gothic novel. </p>

            <p>The genre was invented by Horace Walpole, whose Castle of 
                Otranto (1765) may be said to have founded the 
                horror story as a legitimate literary form. Mary Wollstonecraft 
                Shelley introduced pseudoscience 
                into the genre in her famous novel 
                Frankenstein (1818), about the creation of a 
                monster that ultimately destroys its creator.</p>
