            <div id="accordion">
                <h3>Bus Topology</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Bus topologies are computers that are connected using a single 
                    cable to each other. There are different types of devices connected, so each
                     device is communicating properly. Switches, routers, and computers are all 
                     devices that can be connected to a bus topology. The advantages and disadvantages
                      can vary from different types of network topologies.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Ring Topology</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Another type of network topology is the ring topology which consists of computers 
                    connected to each other in a circle. How they are connected is by, computer one is 
                    connected to computer two and computer two is connected to computer three and this 
                    continues until all computers are connected. 
                  </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Star Topology</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    A star topology is another type of network topology that has every computer on 
                    the network connected to a single hub also known as the central hub. The central hub 
                    can also be a switch which connects all the computers to it. The computers are all connected 
                    to the central hub and indirectly connected to each other. The central hub is a server, and 
                    the other computers are connected to it.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Advantages</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Managing the computers from one computer to the hub are easy</li>
                    <li>being able to add or remove computers from the network is easy</li>
                    <li>there are less cabling</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Mesh Topology</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Mesh topology is a type of network topology that has point to point connection, 
                    where all the computers are connected. Mesh topologies have two different ways of 
                    transmitting data; routing and flooding. Mesh topologies use routing to transmit data 
                    using routing logic to calculate the shortest distance from one computer to the next computer. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, flooding transmits the data to all the computers on the network and 
                    flooding does not require routing logic to get the job done. There are two types of procedures 
                    when using a mesh topology such as full mesh topology and partial mesh topology.

                <div id="tabs-1">
                  <p>Tree topologies is another network topology that can be utilized in
                     setting up a network. Tree topologies have a network architecture that is 
                     shaped comparable to a tree. When using a tree topology, there is a root computer 
                     that is connected to another computer and so on and so forth. This is utilizing the 
                     parent-child hierarchy where there is one computer connected and then two computers connected to it.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="tabs-2">
                  <p>Hybrid topologies are topologies that consist of two or more other topologies such as a bus topology 
                    or a star topology. Hybrid topologies are more likely seen in large networks opposed to in smaller networks 
                    which makes this topology great for big businesses to utilize. Big businesses tend to have different departments, 
                    so a hybrid topology is helpful when the network is set based on the needs of each department. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="tabs-3">
                  <p>In conclusion, there are different types of networks where an individual 
                    and/or business can utilize in their home or business.</p>
                  <p>Each network topology has different advantages and disadvantages, 
                    it really depends on the need of the individual or business which topology 
                    is best suited for the individual or business. </p>
