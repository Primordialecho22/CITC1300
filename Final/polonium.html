    <h2>Polonium</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Polonium was discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie, a Polish chemist, in 1898. She obtained polonium from 
        pitchblende, a material that contains uranium, after noticing that unrefined pitchblende was more radioactive 
        than the uranium that was separated from it. She reasoned that pitchblende must contain at least one other 
        radioactive element. Curie needed to refine several tons of pitchblende in order to obtain tiny amounts of 
        polonium and radium, another radioactive element discovered by Curie. One ton of uranium ore contains only 
        about 100 micrograms (0.0001 grams) of polonium. Due to its scarcity, polonium is usually produced by 
        bombarding bismuth-209 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This forms bismuth-210, which has a half-life 
        of 5 days. Bismuth-210 decays into polonium-210 through beta decay. Milligram amounts of polonium-210 have 
        been produced by this method. <br>
        <br>
        Polonium-210 is a very strong emitter of alpha particles. A single gram of polonium-210 creates 140 Watts 
        of heat energy and is being considered as a lightweight heat source for thermoelectric power for spacecraft. 
        Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138.39 days.  <br>
        <br>
        Polonium's most stable isotope, polonium-209, has a half-life of 102 years. It decays into lead-205 
        through alpha decay. Polonium-209 is available from Oak Ridge National Laboratory at the cost of 
        about $3200 per microcurie. <br>
