    <h2>Fluorine</h2>
    <p class="info"> 
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Fluorine is the most reactive of all elements and no chemical substance is 
        capable of freeing fluorine from any of its compounds. For this reason, fluorine 
        does not occur free in nature and was extremely difficult for scientists to isolate. 
        The first recorded use of a fluorine compound dates to around 1670 to a set of instructions 
        for etching glass that called for Bohemian emerald (CaF2). Chemists attempted to identify 
        the material that was capable of etching glass and George Gore was able to produce a small 
        amount of fluorine through an electrolytic process in 1869. to Gore, fluorine gas explosively 
        combines with hydrogen gas. That is exactly what happened in Gore's experiment when the fluorine 
        gas that formed on one electrode combined with the hydrogen gas that formed on the other electrode. 
        Ferdinand Frederic Henri Moissan, a French chemist, was the first to successfully isolate fluorine 
        in 1886. He did this through the electrolysis of potassium fluoride (KF) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). 
        He also completely isolated the fluorine gas from the hydrogen gas and he built his electrolysis device 
        completely from platinum. His work was so impressive that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry 
        in 1906. Today, fluorine is still produced through the electrolysis of potassium fluoride and 
        hydrofluoric acid as well as through the electrolysis of molten potassium acid fluoride (KHF2).
