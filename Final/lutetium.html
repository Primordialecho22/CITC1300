    <h2>Lutetium</h2>
    <p class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        The mineral gadolinite ((Ce, La, Nd, Y)2FeBe2Si2O10), discovered in a quarry near the 
        town of Ytterby, Sweden, has been the source of a great number of rare earth elements. 
        In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander, a Swedish chemist, was able to separate gadolinite into 
        three materials, which he named yttria, erbia and terbia. As might be expected considering 
        the similarities between their names and properties, scientists soon confused erbia and 
        terbia and, by 1877, had reversed their names. What Mosander called erbia is now called 
        terbia and visa versa. In 1878 Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, a Swiss chemist, 
        discovered that erbia was itself composed of two components. One component was named ytterbia 
        by Marignac while the other component retained the name erbia. Marignac believed that ytterbia 
        was a compound of a new element, which he named ytterbium. Other chemists produced and 
        experimented with ytterbium in an attempt to determine some of it's properties. Unfortunately, 
        different scientists obtained different results from the same experiments. While some 
        scientists believed that these inconsistent results were caused by poor procedures or faulty 
        equipment, Georges Urbain, a French chemist, believed that ytterbium wasn't an element at all, 
        but a mixture of two elements. In 1907, Urbain was able to separate ytterbium into two elements. 
        Urbain named one of the elements neoytterbium (new ytterbium) and the other element lutecium. 
        Carl Auer von Welsbach, an Austrian chemist working independently of Urbain, reached the same 
        conclusions at nearly the same time. Welsbach chose the names albebaranium and cassiopium for 
        these elements. Urbain was eventually credited with the discovery of the elements and won the 
        right to name them, although chemists later changed the name neoytterbium back to ytterbium and 
        changed the spelling of lutecium to lutetium. Today, lutetium is primarily obtained through an 
        ion exchange process from monazite sand ((Ce, La, Th, Nd, Y)PO4), a material rich in 
        rare earth elements.
