    <h2>Niobium</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        The story of niobium's discovery is a bit confusing. The first governor of Connecticut, John Winthrop the Younger, 
        discovered a new mineral around 1734. He named the mineral columbite ((Fe, Mn, Mg)(Nb, Ta)2O6) and sent a sample of 
        it to the British Museum in London, England. The columbite sat in the museum's mineral collection for years until 
        it was analyzed by Charles Hatchett in 1801. Hatchett could tell that there was an element in the columbite, 
        but he was not able to isolate it. He named the new element columbium. The fate of columbium took a drastic 
        turn in 1809 when William Hyde Wollaston, an English chemist and physicist, compared the minerals columbite 
        and tantalite ((Fe, Mn)(Ta, Nb)2O6) and declared that columbium was actually the element tantalum. This confusion 
        arose because tantalum and niobium are similar metals, are always found together and are very difficult to isolate. <br>
        <br>
        Niobium was rediscovered and renamed by Heinrich Rose in 1844 when he produced two new acids, niobic 
        acid and pelopic acid, from samples of columbite and tantalite. These acids are very similar to each 
        other and it took another twenty-two years and a Swiss chemist named Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac 
        to prove that these were two distinct chemicals produced from two different elements. Metallic niobium 
        was finally isolated by the Swedish chemist Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand in 1864. Today, niobium is 
        primarily obtained from the minerals columbite and pyrochlore ((Ca, Na)2Nb2O6(O, OH, F)).
