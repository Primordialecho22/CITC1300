    <h2>Promethium</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        The existence of promethium was predicted by Bohuslav Brauner, a Czech chemist, in 1902. Several groups 
        claimed to have produced the element, but they could not confirm their discoveries because of the difficulty 
        of separating promethium from other elements. Proof of the existence of promethium was obtained by 
        Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin and Charles D. Coryell in 1944. Too busy with defense related 
        research in World War II, they did not claim their discovery until 1946. They discovered promethium while 
        analyzing the byproducts of uranium fission that were produced in a nuclear reactor located at Clinton 
        Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Today, Clinton Laboratories is known as Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
        Today, promethium is still recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission. It can also be produced by 
        bombarding neodymium-146 with neutrons. Neodymium-146 becomes neodymium-147 when it captures a neutron. 
        Neodymium-147, with a half-life of 11 days, decays into promethium-147 through beta decay. Promethium does 
        not occur naturally on earth, although it has been detected in the spectrum of a star in the constellation 
        Andromeda.  <br>
        <br>
        Promethium's most stable isotope, promethium-145, has a half-life of 17.7 years. It decays into neodymium-145 
        through electron capture.
