    <h2>Iodine</h2>
    <p class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Iodine was discovered by the French chemist Barnard Courtois in 1811. Courtois was extracting sodium 
        and potassium compounds from seaweed ash. Once these compounds were removed, he added sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
         to further process the ash. He accidentally added too much acid and a violet colored cloud erupted from the 
         mass. The gas condensed on metal objects in the room, creating solid iodine. Today, iodine is chiefly obtained 
         from deposits of sodium iodate (NaIO3) and sodium periodate (NaIO4) in Chile and Bolivia. Trace amounts of 
         iodine are required by the human body. Iodine is part of thyroxin, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland 
         that controls the body's rate of physical and mental development. A lack of iodine can also cause a goiter, 
         a swelling of the thyroid gland. Iodine is added to salt (iodized salt) to prevent these diseases.
