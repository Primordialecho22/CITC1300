    <h2>Seaborgium</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Seaborgium was first produced by a team of scientists led by Albert Ghiorso working at the Lawrence 
        Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, in 1974. They created seaborgium by bombarding atoms of 
        californium-249 with ions of oxygen-18 using a machine called the Super-Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator. 
        The collision produced atoms of seaborgium-263 and four free neutrons. Seaborgium-263 is an isotope of 
        seaborgium with a half-life of about 1 second. Three months before the Berkeley group announced their 
        discovery, a team of scientists working at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, 
        claimed to have produced seaborgium. Their method involved bombarding atoms of lead-207 and lead-208 
        with ions of chromium-54 with a device called a cyclotron. They believed that they had produced atoms 
        of seaborgium-259. The Berkeley group's work was confirmed in 1993 and they were credited with the 
        discovery. Seaborgium's most stable isotope, seaborgium-271, has a half-life of about 2.4 minutes. 
        It decays into rutherfordium-267 through alpha decay or decays through spontaneous fission.
