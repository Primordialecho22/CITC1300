    <h2>Protactinium</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Protactinium was first identified by Kasimir Fajans and O.H. GÃ¶hring in 1913 while studying uranium's decay chain. 
        The particular isotope they found, protactinium-234m, has a half-life of about 1.17 minutes. They named the element 
        brevium, meaning brief, and then continued with their studies. Protactinium's existence was confirmed in 1918 when 
        another isotope, protactinium-231, was independently discovered and studied by two groups of scientists, Otto Hahn 
        and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain. Protactinium was first isolated 
        by Aristid V. Grosse in 1934. Protactinium is a rare, poisonous and expensive element that is present in uranium 
        ores in very small amounts. In 1961, the Great Britain Atomic Energy Authority was able to produce 125 grams of 
        99.9% pure protactinium, although they had to process about 55,000 kilograms of ore and spend about $500,000 to 
        get it. <br>
        <br>
        Protactinium's most stable isotope, protactinium-231, has a half-life of about 32,760 years. It decays into 
        actinium-227 through alpha decay.
