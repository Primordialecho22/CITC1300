    <h2>Radon</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Radon was discovered by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, a German chemist, in 1900 while studying radium's decay chain. 
        Originally named niton after the Latin word for shining, nitens, radon has been known as radon since 1923. 
        Today, radon is still primarily obtained through the decay of radium. At normal room temperatures, radon is a 
        colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. The most common forms of radon decay through alpha decay. Alpha decay 
        usually isn't considered to be a great radiological hazard since the alpha particles produced by the decay are 
        easily stopped. However, since radon is a gas, it is easily inhaled and living tissue is directly exposed to the 
        radiation. Although it has a relatively short half-life, radon decays into longer lived, solid, radioactive 
        elements which can collect on dust particles and be inhaled as well. For these reasons, there is some concern 
        as to the amount of radon present within homes. Radon seeps into houses as a result of the decay of radium, 
        thorium or uranium ores underground and varies greatly from location to location. On average, the earth's 
        atmosphere is 0.0000000000000000001% radon. <br>
        <br>
        When cooled to its solid state, radon glows yellow. The glow becomes orange-red as the temperature is lowered. <br>
        <br>
        Radon's most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of about 3.8 days. It decays into polonium-218 through 
        alpha decay.
