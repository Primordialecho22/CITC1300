    <h2>Vanadium</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Vanadium was discovered by Andrés Manuel del Rio, a Spanish chemist, in 1801. Rio sent samples of vanadium ore 
        and a letter describing his methods to the Institute de France in Paris, France, for analysis and confirmation. 
        Unfortunately for Rio, his letter was lost in a shipwreck and the Institute only received his samples, which 
        contained a brief note describing how much this new element, which Rio had named erythronium, resembled chromium. 
        Rio withdrew his claim when he received a letter from Paris disputing his discovery. Vanadium was rediscovered 
        by Nils Gabriel Sefstrôm, a Swedish chemist, in 1830 while analyzing samples of iron from a mine in Sweden. 
        Vanadium was isolated by Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe, an English chemist, in 1867 by combining vanadium trichloride 
        (VCl3) with hydrogen gas (H2). Today, vanadium is primarily obtained from the minerals vanadinite (Pb5(VO)3Cl) 
        and carnotite (K2(UO2)2VO4·1-3H2O) by heating crushed ore in the presence of carbon and chlorine to produce 
        vanadium trichloride. The vanadium trichloride is then heated with magnesium in an argon atmosphere.
