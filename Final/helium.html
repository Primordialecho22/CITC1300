    <h2>Helium</h2>
    <p class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, was discovered on the sun 
        before it was found on the earth. Pierre-Jules-CÃ©sar Janssen, a French astronomer, 
        noticed a yellow line in the sun's spectrum while studying a total solar eclipse in 
        1868. Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a 
        wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the 
        time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this 
        mysterious yellow emission. This element was named helium by Lockyer. The hunt to find 
        helium on earth ended in 1895. Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, conducted an 
        experiment with a mineral containing uranium called clevite. He exposed the clevite to 
        mineral acids and collected the gases that were produced. He then sent a sample of these 
        gases to two scientists, Lockyer and Sir William Crookes, who were able to identify the 
        helium within it. Two Swedish chemists, Nils Langlet and Per Theodor Cleve, independently 
        found helium in clevite at about the same time as Ramsay.
        <br>
        <br>
        Helium makes up about 0.0005% of the earth's atmosphere. This trace amount of helium is not 
        gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric 
        helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one 
        type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become 
        a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings. This newly formed helium can 
        eventually work its way to the atmosphere through cracks in the crust.
