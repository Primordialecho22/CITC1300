    <h2>Oxygen</h2>
    <p  class="info">
        Fun Fact: <br>
        Oxygen had been produced by several chemists prior to its discovery in 1774, but they failed to 
        recognize it as a distinct element. Joseph Priestley and Carl Wilhelm Scheele both independently 
        discovered oxygen, but Priestly is usually given credit for the discovery. They were both able to 
        produce oxygen by heating mercuric oxide (HgO). Priestley called the gas produced in his 
        experiments 'dephlogisticated air' and Scheele called his 'fire air'. The name oxygen was created 
        by Antoine Lavoisier who incorrectly believed that oxygen was necessary to form all acids. Oxygen is 
        the third most abundant element in the universe and makes up nearly 21% of the earth's atmosphere. 
        Oxygen accounts for nearly half of the mass of the earth's crust, two thirds of the mass of the human 
        body and nine tenths of the mass of water. Large amounts of oxygen can be extracted from liquefied air 
        through a process known as fractional distillation. Oxygen can also be produced through the electrolysis 
        of water or by heating potassium chlorate (KClO3).
